0009.html	Lethal Weapon (1987)	Steve Fritzinger	LETHAL WEAPON is a light-weight action thriller that quickly degenerates to an extremely stupid movie. While a detective whose name I don't remember is investigating the murder of a friend's daughter, he and his new partner, Riggs, a suicidal burned-out ex-Vietnam sniper, stumble onto a heroin ring. This movie is so loaded with cliches, ex-CIA men turned to crime, a tough looking guy holding his arm in a flame to prove his loyalty to Fearless Leader, kidnapped daughters, and so on, that there is no room left for any genuine suspense.

I'm not sure if it's accurate to say that their new film, "Raising Arizona," is precisely a disappointment, but it certainly isn't at all what I expected, and I didn't really like it. "Raising Arizona" is such a peculiar movie that I find it difficult to analyze my own feelings about it.	NA

0021.html	Lethal Weapon (1987)	Jeff Meyer	LETHAL WEAPON tends to be one of those marginal, on-the-border films; its qualities and weaknesses are glaring, and tend to cancel one another out.

0026.html	Burglar (1987)	Jeff Meyer	I hate having to echo Siskel & Ebert, but something *has* to be done about getting Whoopi Goldberg some decent scripts. Her latest film, BURGLAR, once again tantalizes us with brief glimpses of potential, but smothers it under ridiculous plotting and inadequate backup from supporting characters. The fact that I left the movie liking Goldberg's character, DESPITE some of the lines/situations that had been fed to her, says what kind of actress she is; she has a lot of charisma.	N

Here we have a penthouse apartment inhabited by Abel, a 31-year-old eccentric who has never left the house, and likes to try to kill flies with scissors; and his parents, a Valkyrie-like mother, Dove, who indulges her son's behavior, and the strict, parochial father, Victor, who attempts to have them all lead a "normal life"--though his definition of normal is not particularly wide-spread (thank goodness!).

Which border is never really clear, but they have defiantly crossed into a weird place. On the lam in a town run by Irish bandits, they drink a lot of coffee, beat up a hot dog vendor, and spend a lot of time talking about, but never actually having, sex.	N

Mark and I have a number of long-running debates, including one on the value of movies like DREAMSCAPE, TERMINATOR, and ROBOCOP, and another on the adaptability of super-hero comics to film. If I may be somewhat cavalier, Mark tends to feel these films are unexceptional, while I feel they serve the special purpose of bringing standard SF ideas to a movie audience generally unfamiliar with them.

I'm not sure if it's accurate to say that their new film, "Raising Arizona," is precisely a disappointment, but it certainly isn't at all what I expected, and I didn't really like it. "Raising Arizona" is such a peculiar movie that I find it difficult to analyze my own feelings about it.	NA

I refuse to say things like, "What this film is *really* about is what the film will not show us, and about what Lily didn't want the filmmakers to reveal."	NA
